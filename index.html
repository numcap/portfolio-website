			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Jonathan Ishak, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for
				creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications. Currently,
				I'm in my second year of studies, working towards my degree in Software
				Engineering at Western University. I'm deeply interested in software
				development, with a focus on front-end technologies like React, and
				back-end services like Firebase

				As a professional, I enjoy tackling complex problems and constantly
				learning new skills that will help me grow in the tech world. My
				technical skill-set includes proficiency in JavaScript, React, Firebase,
				and testing with Jest, as well as a solid understanding of algorithms
				and data structures. I've worked on several personal projects, including
				web apps, which have helped me strengthen my coding abilities and
